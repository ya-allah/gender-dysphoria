        <h1>Gender dysphoria</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We've been taught that there are only two chromosome formations, the first formation being "XX" which makes the body female and the second one that is "XY" which makes the body male. This is scientifically inaccurate..</p>
        <p>According to the WHO, the chromosome formations that help determine the gender of people aren't just two types (XX, XY). There are a lot of other types some people have an XXY formation<sup><a href="#resources-1">[1]</a></sup>, some have XXX<sup><a href="#resources-2">[2]</a></sup>, some even have an XXXY formation.<sup><a href="#resources-3">[3]</a></sup> And some people have an XX chromosome formation meaning they should be female but they appear to be male, and there are people who have an XY chromosome formation meaning they should be a male but they appear to be a female.<sup><a href="#resources-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
        <p>So the process of determining someone's gender isn't as easy as people think, either male or female. </p>
        <p>The definition of Transgender individuals is: people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be at birth, basically people whom their outside organs is different from what they feel inside. </p>
        <p>You see a lot of sheikhs and religious clerics calling that a "mental illness that can be cured" or "a choice" or something that happened because of "poor upbringing by parents", some even go as far as saying they should be killed and combated. However this is not the case, it's a normal scientific condition. Nobody goes and says "Oh I wanna be the opposite gender" all of a sudden.</p>
        <p>So Trans individuals have two choices, either to live as they are and accepting the fact that their gender identity isn't compatible to what they feel inside, what they see themselves as because of fear of discrimination or prosecution from the public or even worse, such as killing and burning etc. Or to change some aspects of their physical body to match their view of themselves and their gender identity.</p>
        <p>and gender identity isn't what most people are saying it is, "your outside genitals" or something. In fact gender identity is your conception of yourself.<sup><a href="#resources-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Okay now the scientific reason for someone to be transgender has to do with Genetics, hormones and brain formation in the womb, so no one should say that "someone is a transgender because he/she chose to" or "likes to be one" and you can't say that the person has no morals or manners because he/she is transgender and it's false to say that he/she is like that because their parents didn't raise them well or saying that they're honorless and It is not a social phenomenon or a "ابتلاء من الله" like many uneducated people and religious clerics claim. It's not a social phenomenon it's a scientific condition a normal condition that is present in other organisms as well. and there are people who think theyre cool and mock transgender people because of their appearance even though you shouldnt judge a person based on their appearance but on their ideas and morals because it's not their choice and they're born with it, it is ignorance, this is the nature of their body. it didnt get determined if theyre a boy or a girl yet. and this is a very normal thing in nature because there isn't a line between being a male or a female.<sup><a href="#resources-6">[6]</a></sup> this is present in most living organisms as well. for instance you'll find a male with a clear male body and characteristics but his voice is kind of feminine or a female who has a female body but her voice is kind of deep. there is no shame in that, there is no one who's fully masculine or fully feminine. they're in between and it's the same thing with transgenders you'll see people who are just in the middle, they might have female and male organs at the same time or they might have female genitals but they feel like they're a male inside and vise versa or they might neither look male or female and they're on the process on correcting their bodies to the look they're comfortable with</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Gender dysphoria is the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physical characteristics.</p>
        <p>Transgender and gender-nonconforming people might experience gender dysphoria at some point in their lives. But not everyone is affected. Some transgender and gender-nonconforming people feel at ease with their bodies, either with or without medical intervention.</p>
        <p>Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association to diagnose mental conditions. This term is intended to be more descriptive than the one that was previously used, gender identity disorder. The term gender dysphoria focuses on one's discomfort as the problem, rather than identity. A diagnosis for gender dysphoria was created to help people get access to necessary health care and effective treatment<sup><a href="#resources-7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul class="symp-list-main">
            <li>A marked difference between your inner gender identity and assigned gender lasting at least six months, as shown by at least two of the following:
                <ul class="symp-list-sec">
                    <li class="symp-list-sec-top-child">A marked difference between your inner gender identity and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics, or anticipated secondary sex characteristics in young adolescents</li>
                    <li>A strong desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked difference with your inner gender identity, or a desire to prevent the development of anticipated secondary sex characteristics in young adolescents</li>
                    <li>A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender</li>
                    <li>A strong desire to be of the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender</li>
                    <li>A strong desire to be treated as the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender</li>
                    <li>A strong conviction that you have typical feelings and reactions of the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood (early onset). Or, you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria followed by a recurrence of gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life (late onset)<sup><a href="#resources-8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
